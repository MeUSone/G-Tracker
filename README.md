The extension searches for emails containing delivery-related keywords:

- **Duplicate Prevention**: Won't process the same email twice

### Package Management

- **Delivery Tracking**: Shows when packages were delivered
- **Pickup Status**: Mark packages as picked up to remove from active list
- **Email Links**: Quick access to original delivery emails
